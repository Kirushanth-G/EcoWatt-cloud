# ✅ API Cleanup Complete

## Deleted Endpoints (5 total)

### 1. ❌ `/api/config_ack/` - Removed
**Why:** Old acknowledgment system replaced by unified response in `/api/cloud/write`

### 2. ❌ `/api/fota/firmware/` - Removed
**Why:** Old hardcoded firmware delivery, replaced by database-driven `/api/fota/download`

### 3. ❌ `/api/fota/garbage_firmware/` - Removed
**Why:** Test endpoint for corrupted firmware, not needed in production

### 4. ❌ `/api/fota/guru_firmware/` - Removed
**Why:** Test endpoint for special firmware variant, not needed in production

### 5. ❌ `/api/fota/manifest/` - Removed
**Why:** Old random firmware selector, replaced by manifest in `/api/cloud/write` response

## 🎯 Current Flow

### ESP32 → Cloud
```
POST /api/cloud/write
  ↓
  • Decrypt & validate encrypted data
  • Store sensor readings in database
  • Check for pending config/commands/FOTA
  • Return unified JSON response with:
    - config_update (if any)
    - write_command (if any)
    - fota_manifest (if pending)
```

### Web Interface → API

#### Data Dashboard
```
GET /api/data → Sensor readings
```

#### Configuration Page
```
POST /api/device/config → Queue config update
POST /api/device/write-command → Queue write command
GET /api/device/config/logs → View config history
```

#### FOTA Page
```
POST /api/fota/upload → Upload new firmware
GET /api/fota/current → Current firmware info
GET /api/fota/history → Update history
```

#### ESP32 FOTA Flow
```
1. Cloud/write response includes: fota_manifest
2. ESP32 downloads: GET /api/fota/download
3. ESP32 sends logs: POST /api/fota/log
```

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Cleaner Architecture**
   - One unified endpoint for ESP32 communication
   - No duplicate/overlapping endpoints
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Fewer files to manage
   - Less confusion about which endpoint to use
   - Simpler debugging

3. **Better Performance**
   - Faster Vercel builds
   - Smaller deployment size
   - Less serverless function cold starts

4. **Database-Driven**
   - All firmware stored in database
   - No hardcoded test files
   - Real-time FOTA updates

5. **No Breaking Changes**
   - Old endpoints were never called by current system
   - ESP32 uses unified `/api/cloud/write`
   - Web interface uses new FOTA endpoints
